# ABOUT

A Python module that makes automating Junos devices over the NETCONF API "easy".  The goal of the microframework is to enable Netops/engineers the ability to create Python scripts without requiring "hardcore" programming knownledge.

# STATUS

___WORK IN PROGRESS - UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT___

# QUICK EXAMPLE

The following code illustrates a basic example of opening a NETCONF connection to a device, retrieving the inventory, and displaying the model and serial-number information.

````python
from jnpr.eznc import Netconf

jdev = Netconf(user='jeremy', host='vsrx_cyan', password='jeremy1')
jdev.open()

# invoke the RPC equivalent to "show chassis hardware"

inv = jdev.rpc.get_chassis_inventory()

print "model: %s" % inv.find('chassis/description').text
print "serial-number: %s" % inv.find('chassis/serial-number').text

# model: JUNOSV-FIREFLY
# serial-number: cf2eaceba2b7

jdev.close()

````

# QUICK INTRO TO JUNOS XML API

To determine an XML API command, you use the `| display xml rpc` mechanism, as illustrated:
````
jeremy@jnpr-dc-fw> show chassis hardware | display xml rpc 
<rpc-reply xmlns:junos="http://xml.juniper.net/junos/12.1X44/junos">
    <rpc>
        <get-chassis-inventory>
        </get-chassis-inventory>
    </rpc>
    <cli>
        <banner></banner>
    </cli>
</rpc-reply>
````

The contents between the `rpc` elements is the XML command, in this case `get-chassis-inventory`.  As you can see from the above example, to invoke this API, simply swap the dashes ('-') to underbars ('_').  

If the command has parameters, you do the same.  Here is an example retrieving the status of a given interface:
````
jeremy@jnpr-dc-fw> show interfaces ge-0/0/0 media | display xml rpc 
<rpc-reply xmlns:junos="http://xml.juniper.net/junos/12.1X44/junos">
    <rpc>
        <get-interface-information>
                <media/>
                <interface-name>ge-0/0/0</interface-name>
        </get-interface-information>
    </rpc>
    <cli>
        <banner></banner>
    </cli>
</rpc-reply>
````
The equivalent invocation with this module would look like this:
````python
rsp = jdev.rpc.get_interface_information(media=True, interface_name='ge-0/0/0')
````

# SUPPORTED PRODUCTS

This goal of this module is to provide a general purpose set of utilities and resources.  The module has been designed so that future contributors can easily "plug-in" thier extensions.  This module should work with __ALL__ Junos based products.  There are specific _Resources_ that are platform/function specific.

### SRX

The first pass of this module is targeting resource abstractions for the SRX firewall products.  These resource abstractions include:

 * Security zone interfaces
 * Security zone address-book items and sets
 * Security policy contexts and rule-sets
 * Security screens
 * Security application items and sets
 * Source NAT address pools, rule-sets, and rules
 * Static NAT rule-sets and rules
 
# INSTALLATION

See [here](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.
