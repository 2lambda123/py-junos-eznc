2013-NOV-29:  0.0.2 (EARLY-ADOPTER)

    Extensive changes in the overall framework, but good ones.  Great feedback from the
    early-adopter community has helped to set the useability direction.  Thank you!
    Documentation is being added in the toplevel docs/ directory.  More comming in 0.0.3
    
2013-NOV-01:  0.0.1 (EARLY-ADOPTER)
    
    First "early adopter" release of code that sets the basis of the framework.
    Code is not yet in PyPi, as I want to give it some 'bake time' with the
    community of programmers.
